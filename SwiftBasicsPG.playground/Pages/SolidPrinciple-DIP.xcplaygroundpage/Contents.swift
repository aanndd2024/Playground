 **Problem**: The above example breaks DIP since thereâ€™s a lot of tight coupling and Payment class which is a high-level module is dependent on CreditCardPayment which is a low-level module. As per DIP, it should depend on abstraction/protocol. \
 **Solution**: We can introduce an abstraction (protocol) for payment.
